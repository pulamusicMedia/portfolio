![James Carroll Headshot](/id-portfolio/images/JimHeadshot.JPG)

I am an Instructional Designer, Academic, and Musician living in Massachusetts. I am an experienced and creative educator who has been producing Learning Management System websites, curricula, and materials for nearly 20 years.

Academically, I specialize in [the cultural history of some musicians and writers associated with the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and 70s](https://scholarworks.umass.edu/open_access_dissertations/738/). As a musician I play the guitar, compose music, and gig far too infrequently.
