## Creating an interactive timeline with TimelineJS

Here is an example of an interactive timeline (embedded below) created for an introductory lecture for the second semester of a U.S. history class. This timeline allows for a brief overview of the major events covered in the first semester of the course, roughly covering the years 1492-1865.[^1]

Click on the right and left chevrons ( &#9002;&amp;&#9001; ) to page through the timeline. All of the maps, videos, and links are interactive.
