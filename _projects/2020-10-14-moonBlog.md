## Creating a new blog or site using Jekyll

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator that can be used to quickly create a site that is tailor made to sharing information as either blog posts or static pages. Once the site is set up, content is written in Markdown, a dead simple mark-up language.

[moonBlog](https://pulamusic.github.io/Moon/) is an example blog site created to help disseminate some notes about web development and coding. This site is an adaptation of the [Jekyll Moon theme created by Tayan Tatli](http://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/).
