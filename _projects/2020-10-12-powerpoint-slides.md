## A collection of PowerPoint slides for teaching classes in U.S. history

This is a page I created in 2018 to allow my U.S. history students access to my PowerPoint presentations outside of class. Since all the PowerPoint files are stored in Google Drive, I can edit and expand the files from time to time without having to update the links on this page.

You can either [visit the page here to access all the files](https://pulamusic.github.io/PowerPointSlides.html), or click on the links below to access a few sample PowerPoint presentations.

#### NOTE: At the moment I can't wrap links around the gallery images without messing up the gallery's CSS. Sort that out.
